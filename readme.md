# TagUs Project

This project is work in progress... It is our entry for the QTUM Hackathon 2018.

### Requirements

* QTUM Development Environment
* QTUM Node running
* QTUM qcli and solar available
* MondoDB for storing geo location data and Query
* Express API for serving queries
* React Native for the Mobile App

### The Problem

Most of the time the providers of some product or service have to rely on third-party services to share their works, get requests,
schedule deliveries or pickups and finally the payment processor or bank that all together cause extreme friction on this process
that should be easy to accomplish. The QTUM blockchain is ideal to implement this workflow and remove all this friction.

### The Solution

TagUs is a system to facilitate local trust-less business activities between neighbors or more distant people, preventing abuse or payment issues.
Also, it will allow in the future for the providers to get funding for their projects from the crowd, by selling futures over their productions...
